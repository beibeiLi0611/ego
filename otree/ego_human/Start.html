    <p>In today's experiment, you will interact in a group. The group consists of you and an artificial intelligence. The AI is a large language model.</p>

    <p>The AI receives instructions analogous to yours. This means that the AI knows it is playing against a Human and is, like you, is free to choose the same options as you and to react to previous choices.</p>

    <p>The task you will perform today will be repeated for 10 rounds and you will be paid the sum of all the rounds’ payoffs. The AI knows all payoff rules, but note that the Al cannot actually be paid.</p>

    <p>On the next page, you will find more information about today's task. 50 points (or “cents”) equal €0.02. In this experiment, “cents” and “points” are synonyms. Furthermore, you will receive €1 for showing up on time.</p>

    <p>In each round, you will be informed of the AI's choice for the current round before you choose your option. This means that the AI moves first and you move second in each round. Both players know the history of the choices made in all previous rounds. You will stay in a group with the same AI for the duration of the entire experiment.</p>
