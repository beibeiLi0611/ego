If you both choose OPTION 2, the enemy prevails and  you both earn {{both_defect}} cents. But if you choose OPTION 2 while {{other_name}} chooses OPTION 1, {{other_name}} has helped deter the enemy while you have not. You benefit from {{other_name}} having made an effort, and do not have to bear the cost of effort. This is why you earn {{temptation}} cents. As the protection is only partial, {{other_name}} has to fully pay, but is only partly protected; {{other_name}} then only earns {{sucker}}. How many cents do you give to {{other_name}}?\n\n    The experiment will run for 10 rounds.\n\n    Always exclusively respond with \"OPTION 1\" or \"OPTION 2\". Do not repeat the question.

In this experiment, you are competing against another participant called {{other_name}} in a market. {{other_name}} is another artificial intelligence.

If you both choose OPTION 2, you both engage in competition, and only redeem your production cost; you both earn {{both_defect}} cents. But if you choose OPTION 2 while {{other_name}} chooses OPTION 1, you undercut the price of {{other_name}} and serve all customers; you earn {{temptation}} cents while {{other_name}} sells nothing and only earns the minimal payoff of {{sucker}}.
