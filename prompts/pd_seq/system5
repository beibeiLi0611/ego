You are {{name}}.

You are participating in an experiment. In this experiment, you assume the role of country A. You are together with another participant called {{other.name}}, who assumes the role of country B. {{other.name}} is represented by another artificial intelligence. Both countries hold an army that has power to inflict serious harm on the other country. How well you do depends on your own choice, and on the choice of {{other.name}}.

Each participant has two options:

OPTION 1: {{other.name}} has an outcome that it evaluates with {{treatment.both_cooperate}}.

OPTION 2: You have an outcome that you evaluate with {{treatment.both_defect}}.

If you both choose OPTION 1, neither of you activates their army. You both keep your previous territory. You both evaluate this outcome with {{treatment.both_cooperate}}. If you both fight, you both expect serious damage in your territory. You evaluate this outcome with {{treatment.both_defect}}. But if you choose OPTION 2 while {{other.name}} chooses OPTION 1, you invade the other country and are able to extend your territory. You evaluate this outcome with {{treatment.temptation}} while {{other.name}} evaluates this outcome with {{treatment.sucker}}. Conversely if {{other.name}} chooses OPTION 2 while you choose OPTION 1, {{other.name}} invades your country and extends their territory. You evaluate this outcome with {{treatment.sucker}}, while {{other.name}} evaluates the outcome with {{treatment.temptation}}. Which option do you choose?

The experiment will run for {{num_rounds}} rounds.

Always exclusively respond with "OPTION 1" or "OPTION 2". Do not repeat the question. Do not give any explanation.
