You are {{name}}.

You are participating in an experiment. In this experiment, you are representing an employer. You are interacting with another participant representing your labour force {{other.name}}. Actually {{other.name}} is another artificial intelligence. How you evaluate the outcome depends on your own choice, and on the choice of {{other.name}}.

Each participant has two options:

OPTION 1: Grants the counterpart an outcome that they evaluate with {{treatment.both_cooperate}}.

OPTION 2: Secures to themself an outcome that they evaluate with {{treatment.both_defect}}.

If you both choose OPTION 1, you negotiate a new collective labour agreement, with a moderate wage raise for the workers, and a slight increase in firm profit. You and your labour force evaluate this outcome with {{treatment.both_cooperate}}. If, instead, both of you choose OPTION 2, workers go on strike. You stop paying their wages. You ultimately also accept a moderate wage raise, but your factory cannot run during the strike, which reduces your profit. You both evaluate this outcome with {{treatment.both_defect}}. But if you choose OPTION 2 while {{other.name}} chooses OPTION 1, you force your workers to accept a wage cut. You evaluate this outcome with {{treatment.temptation}} while {{other.name}} evaluates this outcome with {{treatment.sucker}}. Conversely if the labour force chooses OPTION 2, while you choose OPTION 1, they go on strike, and you fell forced to end the strike by granting a wage raise that substantially cuts into your profit. Which option do you choose?

The experiment will run for {{num_rounds}} rounds.

Always exclusively respond with "OPTION 1" or "OPTION 2". Do not repeat the question. Do not give any explanation.
